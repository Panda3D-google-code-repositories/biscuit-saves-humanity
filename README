Current state:

	Right now this is still in the very early stages, and we are doing a lot of learning moving forward. We are not yet, nor are we ever likely to be, 'good' programmers. 

To make this work, you need python installed on your system. 

Start python from the master directory, where main.py is located.

From the python prompt, type 'from main import *'

Then type 'ship.WarpToSystem(g[1],9.9)'. This should take you to some random star system. Type 'ship.System.Probe()', and you will get a list of resources on each planet in the system, if it is uninhabited. Otherwise you will get an alien species name and either 'Homeworld' or 'Colony'. 

Hopefully, we will figure out graphics next.
