class StarBase():

""" StarBase should have attributes that include hipoints, armaments, fleet vessels, etc.
 Keeping it simple, one StarBase represents alien presence in a star system. No need to worry
 about individual planets, except for resource harvesting. Player should be able to see the resources
 present in a system, but not be able to harvest them with an alien presence.  This will hopefully
 cause the player to think long and hard about attacking vicious aliens to steal their stuff. """
